Combat Log to XML Program:

To-Done:
Reads in .txt file
Splits lines into strings (kind of)
Converts file to be UTF-8

To-Do:
File is not reading in as intended
Each combat action is one single line
Could be one of 3 things:
	After being converted, file is losing commas and therefor not splitting (check array size)
	Using combat lines as Text files is causing them to be one line (check how TextNode works in XML)
	Splitter is not recognizing it's splitting ability correctly (though it did on the test file, so not likely)
